<a href='https://github.com/Webb-School-Computer-Science-Club/Verallel'>Check out the Chrome version!</a><br>
This release is currently updated to the beta v1.0.5  of the chrome version. It will be released onto the Firefox Addons Store along with the release of the Chrome v1.1.0

# Verallel
A student-made, student-tailored Firefox addon for Veracross. Provides ease of navigation in Veracross, with other quality of life features, and even more in progress.<br>
Currently, the only features of the extension are to add a link to the dropbox from any class popup in the class tab and to remove the mess of numbers and letters before the name of the actual class in the class tab, but other featues are going to come soon!<br>
Unfortunatley, at the moment, this extension is compatible only for Webb students, as the links will not work if your Veracross is a different school.

# Issue Handling
When it comes to repository issues, please keep in mind that the developer team for Verallel has an order of priorities for issue fixing. There isn't a rigid order, but expect issues about major bugs to be solved first over adding minor feature enhancements. This shouldn't deter you from making an issue for a bug or a feature request if you have one, but acknowledge that there a limited amount of people on the team, each with other commitments of their own. <br> If you make an issue about a bug, please detail how you got to the bug and if that bug is consistently reproducible. Additionally, make sure your issue is not already an issue on the repository. 

# Helping with Development
If you wish to help with the development of the site, the zip folder release of the extension will be provided (and maybe some other beta versions the dev team is working on). If you are not part of the dev team and end up making yor own working version please publish the code as a fork of this repository.

# Potential Feature Additions the Dev Team has High on the Bucket List
